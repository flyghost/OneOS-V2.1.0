**PLEASE REMOVE THIS TEMPLATE BEFORE SUBMITTING**

Before submitting a PR, please, make sure that:

- Changes are in a separate branch, not in master.
- The branch contains only one commit on top of master (if not, squash them into
  one commit).
- The commit has a descriptive commit message with a concise title (first line).
- The commit message contains `fixes #XXXX` or `closes #XXXX` to auto-close the
  issue(s) that the PR fixes (if any).
- Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features).
- Documentation has been added / updated (if applicable).
- All new and existing tests passed locally (if not, fix them first and amend
  the commit).

IMPORTANT: Please review the CONTRIBUTING.md file for detailed contributing
guidelines.
